Utility to install openstack on RHEL 6.3  (Openstack Essex)

This utility can be used to install openstack on a single or 
group of hosts (over ssh)

This utility is still in the early stages, a lot of the configuration
options have yet to be added

Installation 
$ yum install -y git cracklib-python
$ git clone git://github.com/derekhiggins/os-installer.git
$ git clone git://github.com/derekhiggins/installer.git
$ cd installer

# Edit the file basedefs.py to point to os-installer
DIR_PROJECT_DIR = "../os-installer"

Option 1 (using answer file)
$ python run_setup.py --gen-answer-file=ans.txt

# then edit answers.txt as appropriate e.g.
o set CONFIG_SSH_KEY to a public ssh key to be installed to remote machines
o Edit 127.0.0.1 to anywhere you want to install a piece of openstack on another server
o Edit the 3 network interfaces to whatever makes sense in your setup 
o If your testing on a vm then set CONFIG_LIBVIRT_TYPE=qemu

$ python run_setup.py --answer-file=ans.txt

Option 2 (prompts for configuration options)
$ python run_setup.py

thats it, if everything went well you can now start using openstack
$ cd
$ . keystonerc_admin
$ nova list
$ swift list  # if you have installed swift
